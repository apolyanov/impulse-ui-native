# Commit Style

Use Conventional Commits so the history stays readable and easy to scan.

## Format

```text
<type>(<scope>): <short imperative summary>
```

Examples:

```text
fix(primitives): declare safe-area peer dependency
fix(toolkit): mirror re-exported package peers
feat(select): add grouped option support
refactor(theme): simplify component token lookup
chore(lockfile): refresh pnpm importer metadata
```

## Types

Use these commit types:

| Type | Use For |
| --- | --- |
| `feat` | New user-facing behavior or public API |
| `fix` | Bug fixes or incorrect dependency metadata |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring without behavior changes |
| `chore` | Repo maintenance, dependency updates, tooling, cleanup |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `test` | Tests only |
| `style` | Formatting only, no logic changes |
| `build` | Build output, bundling, package build config |
| `ci` | GitHub Actions or CI configuration |

## Scopes

Prefer package, app, or repo-area scopes:

```text
core
theme
primitives
icon
flyout
data-state
toolkit
impulse-ui-native
finansu-furendu-native
repo
deps
lockfile
```

When a change touches several packages, use a broader scope:

```text
fix(packages): correct dependency metadata
chore(repo): establish initial monorepo baseline
```

## Summary Rules

- Write the summary in imperative mood: `add`, `fix`, `remove`, `update`.
- Keep it short, usually under 72 characters.
- Do not use vague messages like `saving`, `fix`, or `changes`.
- Mention the most important outcome, not every edited file.

Good:

```text
fix(flyout): add missing native peer dev dependencies
```

Avoid:

```text
saving
fix
updated files
```

## Body

Add a body when the reason matters or the change is not obvious.

```text
fix(packages): correct dependency metadata

Add missing dev/peer dependency declarations for package-local imports,
remove an unused data-state peer, and align toolkit peers with its
re-exported package surface.
```

## Squash Baseline

If the repo history is squashed into a new baseline, use:

```text
chore(repo): establish initial monorepo baseline
```

After that, keep commits small and reviewable. A good commit should describe
one coherent change that can be understood without opening every file.
